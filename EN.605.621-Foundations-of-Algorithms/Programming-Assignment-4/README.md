# Programming Assignment 4

*Bradley Wolinski*

## Description

The purpose of this assignment is to implement an algorithm tat will decode an incoming signal, $s$, to determine $s$ is an interweaving of $x$, $y$, and potential noise. The specifications of the assignment are in the [assignment description](prog4_SP25.pdf). Different runtime configurations can be ran by using command line arguments.

## Setup Instructions

1. Ensure that [Python](https://www.python.org/downloads/) is installed.
2. Execute *...Virtual-Environment/SetupVirtualEnvironment.bat*, which will setup a [Virtual Environment](https://docs.python.org/3/library/venv.html) with all project dependencies required for compiling and running.

*Note: [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/Download) was used for development and debugging.*

## Run Instructions

- Execute *...Output\TestCases.bat*
