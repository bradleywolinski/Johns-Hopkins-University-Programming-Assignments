# Programming Assignment 1

*Bradley Wolinski*

## Description

The purpose of this programming assignment is to implement an efficient algorithm that determines a certain number of closest of points in a series of points using their Manhattan Distance. The specifications of the assignment are in the [assignment description](prog1_SP25.pdf). Different runtime configurations can be ran by using command line arguments.

## Setup Instructions

1. Ensure that [Python](https://www.python.org/downloads/) is installed.
2. Execute *...Virtual-Environment/SetupVirtualEnvironment.bat*, which will setup a [Virtual Environment](https://docs.python.org/3/library/venv.html) with all project dependencies required for compiling and running.

*Note: [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/Download) was used for development and debugging.*

## Run Instructions

- Execute *...Output\TraceRuns.bat*
- Execute *...Output\TestRuns.bat*
